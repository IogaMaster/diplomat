With diplomat you can build servers as packages with a simple interface and deploy them with the included module.

- 🏗️ Builders that make packaging and running servers simple:
    - mkGenericServer (builder for any server)
    - mkMinecraftServer (builder for mcman based servers)
    - mkSteamServer (wrapper for steamcmd and steam-run)
- ⚙️ A module for running servers with additional tools:
    - 🏭 Runs the server
    - 🌐 Sets up proxy (playit.gg, ngrok, cloudflare tunnels)
    - 🫙 Works great on host, nixos-containers, and microvms
- 📦 Packages not present in nixpkgs (yet) that are useful for servers.
    - [mcman](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman)
    - [playit](https://playit.gg/)
